1. Respecting the **purpose of our community**, our activities, and our ways of gathering
2. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others
3. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences
4. **Taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions
5. Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**
6. Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs
7. Behaving in other ways that promote the **well-being of our community**
